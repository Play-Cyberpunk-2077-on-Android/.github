# Can You Play Cyberpunk 2077 on Android?

Imagine exploring the neon-lit streets of Night City, encountering its diverse cast of characters, and diving into its action-packed story… all on your Android phone! While *Cyberpunk 2077* captured the imaginations of gamers worldwide upon its release, the dream of experiencing this sprawling RPG on a mobile device seemed like a distant fantasy.

## Emulation: The Gateway to Night City on Android

The magic that enables you to run *Cyberpunk 2077*, a game designed for powerful PCs, on your Android phone lies in emulation. Emulators are software programs that mimic the hardware and software environment of a different system, allowing you to run programs not natively designed for your device. In this case, we’re talking about emulators that create a Windows environment on your Android phone, enabling you to run PC games.

Several emulators have gained popularity for running Windows games on Android, including:

- **Mobox**  
- **Winlator**  
- **Horizon**  

Recently, an X (formerly Twitter) user showcased the Snapdragon 8 Elite running *Cyberpunk 2077* through a pre-release PC emulator developed by **Eggns**.

Each emulator has its strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance, compatibility, and features. Some may offer better performance for specific games or devices, while others might prioritize ease of use or customization options. Choosing the right emulator often involves some trial and error to find the best fit for your needs.

## Hardware Requirements: Powering the Cyberpunk Experience

To run *Cyberpunk 2077* on your Android phone, you’re going to need a fairly powerful device. The minimum requirements likely include:

- **Processor**: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or newer (Snapdragon 8 Elite recommended)  
- **GPU**: Adreno 830 or better  
- **RAM**: 8GB or more  

Some Android phones known to handle the game, albeit with performance variations, are the **Lenovo Legion Y70** (Snapdragon 8 Gen 1) and the **REDMAGIC 9 Pro**.

It’s important to remember that emulation always involves a performance trade-off compared to playing the game natively on a PC or console.

## Performance: Balancing Visuals and Smooth Gameplay

While it’s exciting to think about playing *Cyberpunk 2077* on your Android phone, it’s crucial to temper expectations regarding performance. Emulating a demanding game like *Cyberpunk 2077* inevitably leads to compromises in graphics quality and frame rates.

- **Snapdragon 8 Elite**: Potential for 60 FPS at 720p with Low graphics settings and upscaling technologies like AMD FSR.  
- **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3**: Achieves 30 FPS on the Low preset.  

Even with top-tier hardware, you might still experience occasional choppiness or performance fluctuations during gameplay.

## Gameplay: Adapting to a Touchscreen Interface

Playing a complex game like *Cyberpunk 2077* on a touchscreen presents its own set of challenges. Navigating menus, controlling your character, and aiming weapons using touch controls can feel less precise than using a keyboard, mouse, or gamepad.

**Tips for Enhancing Gameplay on Android:**

- Use emulators with customizable control schemes.  
- Connect a Bluetooth controller for a more immersive experience.
